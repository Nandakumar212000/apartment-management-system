#Apartment Management System
------------------------------
This project helps large apartment complexes manage house owners, tenants, visitors, security, and maintenance personnel effortlessly.

* House owners can book maintenance, create visitor passes, arrange product delivery pickups, and raise complaints from their accounts.
* Security can create temporary visitor passes, scan visitor passes, and monitor CCTV cameras through their accounts.
* Maintenance personnel can track, view, and update their work through their accounts.
* The admin (building president) can view complaints from house owners and accept or reject users after verification.

We Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, PHP, Ajax and some other 3rd party libraries in this AMS Project. It is also made responsive with all screen sizes.
I worked as a Frontend Developer in this project expects Complaints Page from adimn and other users pages.
