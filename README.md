#Apartment Management System
------------------------------
This project helps large apartment complexes manage house owners, tenants, visitors, security, and maintenance personnel effortlessly.

* House owners can book maintenance, create visitor passes, arrange product delivery pickups, and raise complaints from their accounts.
* Security can create temporary visitor passes, scan visitor passes, and monitor CCTV cameras through their accounts.
* Maintenance personnel can track, view, and update their work through their accounts.
* The admin (building president) can view complaints from house owners and accept or reject users after verification.
